Packed to Streaming Conversion for Real and Complex Matrices

Description: convert a sequence of L MxN matrices from packed (block) order
to streaming order. Use rbs*() functions for real data, and cbs*() functions -
for complex data.

Representation:
<r|c>bs<size>    16-bit fixed-point data
<r|c>bs<size>f   IEEE-754 Std single precision floating-point data

Storage size SX denotes the number of data elements required to store an
MxN matrix X in block order. If matrix size M*N is less than the SIMD vector
size for appropriate data type, then the storage size equals M*N rounded up
to the next power of two, otherwise SX equals M*N rounded up to the next
multiple of the SIMD vector size.

SIMD vector size:
  - for real fixed-point data 2*BBE_SIMD_WIDTH/sizeof(int16_t) == 16
  - for complex fixed-point data 2*BBE_SIMD_WIDTH/sizeof(complex_fract16) == 8
  - for real floating-point data 2*BBE_SIMD_WIDTH/sizeof(float32_t) == 8
  - for complex floating-point data 2*BBE_SIMD_WIDTH/sizeof(complex_float) == 4

Parameters:
Input:
x[L][SX]   Input sequence of MxN matrices, block order
M          Number of rows in a matrix
N          Number of columns in a matrix
L          Number of matrices
Output:
y[M*N][L]  Output sequence of matrices, streaming order

Restrictions:
x,y      Aligned on 32-byte boundary
x,y      Must not overlap
L        Must be a multiple of:
           16 for real fixed-point data 
            8 for complex fixed-point data and real floating-point data
            4 for complex floating-point data
